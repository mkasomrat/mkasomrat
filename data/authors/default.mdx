❝Hey, look! This is me, Muhammad Kawsar Ahmad Somrat | Ṭālib-e-‘ilm | Dā‘ī ilallāh | Phīlānthrōpist |❞


﷽
In the Name of Allâh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Alhamdulillah, All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala says, “And who is better in speech than he who [says: “My Lord is Allâh (believes in His Oneness),” and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allâh’s (Islâmic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: “I am one of the Muslims.”” (Surah Fussilat, 41:33)

also a hadith, "When someone calls to guidance, whoever follows him will have an equal reward, but there will be no reduction in the reward of those who followed." [Sahih Muslim:2678]

So dear brothers and sisters, in this verse [41:33], Allah Almighty describes those people as the best who call others towards Him, invite them to His path, and also engage in righteous deeds themselves. Despite attaining such a great honor, they do not become arrogant; rather, they humbly say, "I am just an ordinary Muslim like you." The power and beauty of words captivate hearts and inspire people. Also in the mentioned hadith, what a profitable business it's to calling people to the way of Almighty Allah.To attract those around you towards Allah and seek His reward, speak with humility, explain with wisdom, and invite others sincerely. At the same time, strive to practice good deeds yourself.
